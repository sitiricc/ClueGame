---------------------------------------------------------------------

I. OBJECTIVE: 

Be the first player to correctly guess which cards are in the case file envelope. This is done by process of elimination.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

II. SETUP:

1. Place each piece on its corresponding part on the board.

2. Doesn't matter whch room the weapon pieces start in.

3. Separate the cards into three piles: 
        a. Suspects
        b. Rooms
        c. Weapons

4. Place one card from each category into the case file envelope.

5. Shuffle the remaining cards and deal to all players. It's ok with some players have more cards than others.

6. Give each player a sheet where they can mark off the cards they have received since these are not in the case file envelope.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

III. GAMEPLAY:

1. Miss Scarlet always goes first.

2. A player will roll two dice on their turn.

3. The player can then move spaces up to the combined number rolled. They don't have to use all spaces.

4. When a player reaches a room, they can make a suggestion for the three cards in the middle (suspect and cards). 
    - Note: going into a room is a separate move.

5. When a player makes a suggestion, they will move the suspect and weapon into the room. The room the player is in is always the room that has to be suggested.
    - Note: A suspect that is moved to a room for a suggestion will remain in that room and will not go back to their previous spot.

6. The player to the left of the suggesting player will secretly show the suggesting player a card that proves the suggestion wrong if possible.
    - If the player doesn't have a card to show, the next player to the left will secretly show a card to the player who made the accusation.

7. The player will mark off the card.

8. Next player to the left of the previous one goes. If they don't enter a room, they can't make a suggestion.

NOTES: There is a secret passage that moves a player from the lounge to the conservatory and back. Or the kitchen to the study and back. A player can't move diagonally and can't move through a space already occupied by another player's spot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. WINNING CONDITIONS:

1. When a player thinks they know the three hidden cards, the player can make an accusation. Only one accusation can be made per player per game and only on their turn affter they make a suggestion.

2. Unlike a suggestion, an accusation doesn't need to be in the room they are currently in. To make an accusation, the player must state they are doing so.

2. If nobody can disprove any card, the player checks the envelope. If the cards are correct, the player wins the game. If the player is incorrect, they return the cards to the envelope and doesn't get any more turns. They will still show cards when needed.
